		When Pat sees a need to learn new technology, Pat <span style="color:red;"><u>does
			so by trying out new features</u></span> or commands to see what they
			do and to understand how the software works. Pat does this <span style="color:red;"><u> purposefully;
			that is, <span class="pronoun">they</span> reflect<span class="verb-other"></span>
			on each bit of feedback <span class="pronoun">they</span> get<span class="verb-other"></span>
		</u></span> along the way to understand how <span class="pronoun">they</span> might benefit
			from the feature. Eventually, if Pat doesn't think it will get them closer to what
			<span class="pronoun">they</span> want<span class="verb-other"></span> to achieve,
			<span class="pronoun">they</span> will <span style="color:red;"><u>revert back
			to ways that <span class="pronoun">they</span> already<span class="verb-other"></span>
			know will work.</u></span></span>
